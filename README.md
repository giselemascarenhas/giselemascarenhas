# Hello World 👋

My name's Gisele Ramos. I'm from Brazil and I'm an enthusiast in the world of technology. 👩🏼‍💻

Currently, I'm learning **Java**. But I've already learned a little about **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS3**, **CSS Grid**, **Flexbox**,  **Bootstrap** and others.

I'm looking to become a backend developer but I want to learn a little bit of everything. 📚 ✨
